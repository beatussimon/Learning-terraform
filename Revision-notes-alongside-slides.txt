TERRAFORM:
Imperative Languages

You write explicit instructions for the computer to follow in order.

Think of it like giving a recipe: step 1, step 2, step 3.

You manage the program state and control flow (loops, conditionals).

Examples: C, Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby.

Pros: More control, often easier for complex algorithms.

Cons: Can be more verbose and error-prone.

Declarative Languages

You specify what you want as the outcome, not the steps to get there.

The underlying system figures out how to achieve it.

Often more concise and readable.

Examples:

SQL (query data without specifying search algorithm)

HTML/CSS (describe page layout, not browser rendering steps)

Functional languages (like Haskell) emphasize declarative style.

Logic programming (Prolog).

Pros: Easier to reason about, less boilerplate.

Cons: Less control over performance and execution details.



Terraform sits in the middle between imperative and declarative  where it lets you use the declarative stuff wile fiving you
options to upgrade and up and use the complex data structure etc.

Visualizing the execution plans:
In cloud computing, provisioning is the process of setting up and configuring the necessary IT resources, like virtual machines, storage, and networking, to run applications and services. It includes both the initial setup of the underlying infrastructure and the on-demand allocation of resources and services to users, often automated to be fast and efficient. 
Key aspects of cloud provisioning
Infrastructure setup: This involves creating the foundational components of the cloud environment, such as networking, storage, and the virtualization layers.
Resource allocation: Once the infrastructure is in place, this step involves making specific resources available to users. This can include allocating virtual machines, databases, and other services as needed.
Automation: Modern cloud provisioning heavily relies on automation to make the process faster and less prone to human error. This can be done through scripts, templates like ARM templates, or tools that define infrastructure as code.
User access: It also includes establishing access for authorized users by setting up their accounts and permissions to access the resources they need.
Dynamic and self-service: Cloud provisioning can be dynamic, automatically adjusting resources based on demand, and can also be self-service, allowing users to request and set up their own resources through a portal.

Provisioning: In IT, provisioning is the process of creating infrastructure and making it available to end users. Configuration: It is the process of configuring the provisioned IT infrastructure resources. For example, installing and configuring a database on a server or configuring network and firewall settings.1
Infrastructure is provisioned as code
Servers are created and destroyed in seconds
Long lived and mutable -> now they are short lived and immutable

Three main approaches for provisioning cloud resources:
=> GUI
-> API/CLI
-> Iac

Categories of Iac
-> Ad hoc scripts => tells you what infrastructure to provision
=> configuration management tools
=> server templating tool -> this category is for building out a template for what you are going to 
	provision to a server
	AMI=> amazon machine image or basically any machine image is built in from some image and you 
	all your dependencies into your image

=> orchastration tools

These are for how you can define your application deployment, less of how you can define the servers behind it
	but take your code and deploy it in a certain way in whatever system you have provisioned in the background

=> Provisioning tools
	Focused on provisioning those cloud resources to begin with

Declarative tools=> you define the end state of what you want eg. i want 5 servers 1 load balancer etc. and the tool manages the
	api and what calls needs to be made to make that happen
Imperative tools=> You tell the system what you want to happend and the sequence you want that to happen
	and most of the configuration tools falls on the imperative side of the tools that can make them more declarative

Lots of terraform tools falls on the declarative side where you define the end state of what you want to take place
and you then let the tool handle the details of how to get there
